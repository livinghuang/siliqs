# SILIQS - IoT PCB Project

Welcome to the SILIQS project! This repository contains a range of PCB boards designed for IoT applications. Our project includes main boards for communication and several peripheral boards to support these main boards for various user purposes.

## Main Boards

Main boards are designed for communication and include a unique identifier in their name, starting with "SQxxx," where "xxx" represents the board number. For example, SQ001 is our first main board.

| Board Name       | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [SQ001S](./sq001/readme.md) | A versatile IoT development platform with RISC-V power and Arduino compatibility. |

## Peripheral Boards for Sensors

Peripheral boards designed for sensor applications are named starting with "SQSxxxx," where "xxxx" corresponds to the vendor and sensor chip name. For instance, SQS1080 is our board designed for the TI HDC1080 chip with an SQS interface.

| Board Name       | Description                                 |

| [SQS6DS3](./sqs6ds3/readme.md) | 6 axis Sensor Board  |
| [SQSCD40](./sqscd40/readme.md) | CO2 gas Sensor Board |
| [SQC485](./sqc485/readme.md) | Integrated RS485 communication |
| [SQCuSD](./sqcusd/readme.md) | Integrated mirco SD Card |
| [SQCNBIOT](./sqcnbiot/readme.md) | Integrated NBIOT communication |
| [SQC4G](./sqc4g/readme.md) | Integrated 4G communication |
| [SQSH001](./sqsh001/readme.md) | Serves as a versatile housing, accommodating SMA Antennas, IPEX1 Antennas, Li-ion Batteries, and USB connectors. |

## Peripheral Boards for Communication

Peripheral boards designed for communication purposes are named starting with "SQCxxx," where "xxx" indicates the communication method. For example, SQC485 is our board designed for RS485 communication.
