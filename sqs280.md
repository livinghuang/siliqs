## Example Code

Here's a sample Python code snippet to read air pressure and temperature data from the SQS280 using a Raspberry Pi:

```python
# Sample Python code to read data from SQS280 using a Raspberry Pi
import smbus2
import time

# Define the I2C bus number (usually 1 for Raspberry Pi)
bus = smbus2.SMBus(1)

# BMP280 address
bmp280_addr = 0x76

# Configure BMP280 for air pressure and temperature measurements
bus.write_byte_data(bmp280_addr, 0xF4, 0x27)

# Read data from BMP280
data = bus.read_i2c_block_data(bmp280_addr, 0xF7, 8)

# Convert data to temperature and air pressure
temperature = ((data[3] << 12) + (data[4] << 4) + (data[5] >> 4)) / 100.0
pressure = ((data[0] << 16) + (data[1] << 8) + data[2]) / 100.0

print(f"Temperature (BMP280): {temperature}Â°C")
print(f"Air Pressure (BMP280): {pressure} hPa")
