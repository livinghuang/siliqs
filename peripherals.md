To facilitate easy integration and compatibility across our ecosystem, the SILIQS project adopts standardized guidelines for peripheral connectivity:

- **Modular Design:** Peripherals feature a modular design for quick plug-and-play integration with mainboards.
- **Communication Standards:** Utilizes standard communication protocols (SPI, I2C, UART) for seamless data exchange with mainboards.
- **Power Management:** Efficient power management protocols to ensure peripherals do not drain the system's battery life unnecessarily.
- **Scalability:** Peripherals are designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future upgrades without necessitating major changes to the mainboard.

These guidelines ensure that peripherals can be easily added, removed, or swapped, enhancing the modularity and flexibility of SILIQS project IoT solutions.

## Expanding the Ecosystem

The SILIQS project is committed to continually expanding its range of supported peripherals, thus broadening the horizons of what our IoT solutions can achieve. Developers are encouraged to explore the use of various peripherals to discover new possibilities and applications within their projects.
